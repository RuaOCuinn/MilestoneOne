### Design

- ####    Colour Scheme
    - The colours used for the website were chosen in an attempt to pull the user into the fantastical worlds created by the author; worlds where nature is still prevelant with all its natural green's and browns
     but also where blood is freely spilled by the characters created therein.
     To this effect I have chosen a mixture of Bistre bark brown (#3f2413), Rifle Green (#404634) and Laurel Green (#afbe8f) for that immersive feeling of nature. And Ruby Red (#a3001e) for that hint of blood and feeling of danger.

- ####    Typography
    - The main font I have chosen is 'Roboto' It is easy to read, stands out and will hopefully remind users of an easy to read book. I will use sans-serif as a backup font.

    - The secondary font used is 'PT Serif' to help headings and titels to stand out from the rest of the text.
