### Design

- ####    Colour Scheme
    - The colours used for the website were chosen in an attempt to pull the user into the dark fantasy worlds created by the author; worlds where darkness is prevelant and the grey steel of swords and spears rules. 
    I have therefor chosen a base color of black with a secondary grey color (#85898c). It is my hope that these basic colours will also work well to not clash with the different colours of the author's book covers displayed on the website.
    And Ruby Red (#a3001e) for that hint of blood and feeling of danger.

        <img src="INSERT IMAGE OF PALETTE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!">

- ####    Typography
    - The main font I have chosen is 'Roboto' It is easy to read, stands out and will hopefully remind users of an easy to read book. I will use sans-serif as a backup font.

    - The secondary font used is 'PT Serif' to help headings and titels to stand out from the rest of the text.

- ####    Images (Needs more ones images decided upon!!!!!!)
    - The main use of images for this website will be the ones used for book covers. As none of the books on the website are real I will have to acquire some suitable ones.

- #### Wireframes
    - All wireframes were made using Balsamiq.
    
    - Mobile Wireframe
